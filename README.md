# NYT React App

[NYT React App](https://nytreactsn.herokuapp.com/) is a full stack application using ReactJS, Mongoose, Axios, and Express.

The application lets the user search the New York Times Articles API. The user is given three criteria; "Search Term", "Start Year", and "End Year". The "Start Year" and "End Year" are optional. Once the api is queried a list of results populates the page below the search form. The user can then save these article to the mongo db database. There is also a "Saved" tab the user can click on to see their saved articles and delete them from the database.
